## Creation

This is a memory game which was creating using html, css and javascript. 
All application behavior can be found in the javascript file (app.js).

## How to Play
Once the page loads, you will be playing the game. The objective is to find all two pairs of cards by flipping two at the time. *Good Luck!*

## Resources
External libraries like Jquery and Jquery ui were added to improve the application. Jquery UI was used in order to add animations to the game. Image icons were added using Font Awesome.


## Contributing
No contribution is required since it is a personal project, but feel free to download it and play with everything you see in the code.
